# Subvocal Representations of Natural Language for Text Classification

_Def:_ Internal dialog or subvocalization commonly occurs during silent reading where individuals silently speak or hear the text that is read â€“ _did you notice as you read this?_

In this work we join the textual features and generated audio sequences of text-only data in a neural network to better model the process of subvocalization.
